💡 I'm a backend engineer with 5+ years of experience in developing scalable web-based products.

📖 I love learning new stuff related to the tech world. I studied applied ML for a master's at the University College London whilst I did my career break.

⛰️ In my free time, I love hiking. I live in Indonesia, and we have a lot of nice mountains here. My favourite one is Mt. Merbabu!
